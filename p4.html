        <p>    </p>  <p>We aim to educate the community on the latest technology, trends and skills,to facilitate recruiting oppurtunities and to make new generations to adapt for emerging new technological techniques.This is the informative platform for the students where they can get the info about new inventions and the adaptation of new technologies in the emerging new fields of the corporate world.
     In this platform we provide students for open discussion,debates,and sharing ideas.It also encourages to work on projects.

     <h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
        <br>
     The overall research goal of AI is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner.AI has developed many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science.a few of them are search and optimisation,probability methods for uncertain reasoning etc.AI is relevant to any intellectual task.Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and too numerous to list here but their usage in the fields of healthcare(X-ray with automatic calculation of bone age),automative(driverless cars) ,finance and economics etc.
     This is  one the most trending technology of these days.

 <h2>MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
 <br>
 <b> Computing Machinery and Intelligence </b>,in which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?".There are many applications for Machine Learning,few are in the field of Agriculture,credit-card fraud,DNA sequence classification etc.Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields,ML programs often fail to deliver expected results.Reasons for this are numerous:lack of data,lack of access to data etc.
 Software suites containing a variety of ML algorithms ,few are CNTK,ELKI,Mallet,Caffe etc.Machine Learning is quickly growing field in Computer Science.It has its applications in nearly every other field of study and is already being implemented commercially because machine learning can solve problems too difficult or time consuming for humans to solve.

       <h2>INTERNET OF THINGS</h2>
       <br>
       A growing portion of IoT devices are created for consumer use,including connected vehicles,home automation,wearable technology,connected health,and appliances with remote monitoring capabilities.The IoT's major significant trend in recent years is explosive growth of devices connected and controlled by the internet.
